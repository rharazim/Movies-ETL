# Movies-ETL
Module 8 ETL

Overview:
We work for Amazing Prime, a movie and tv streaming service, and we were tasked with creating a database for a hackathon. We used movie data from wikipedia, kaggle metadata and a MovieLens rating data and combined all the useful information into a dataframe using Pandas in python. In this analysis, we refactored our code to create an automated pipeline that will take in a given set of data and clean it up and deliver it to a SQL database. This process demonstrates the ETL process or Extract Transform Load.
